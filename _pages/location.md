## Travel

Participants should aim to arrive on Sunday, August 22nd. The workshop will officially end on the evening of the 27th, but participants can stay through August 28th if they wish to participate in outreach activities for the local public.

One easy way to get to Foix is by train through Toulouse (~70 minutes by regional train “TER” from Toulouse’s Matabiau station: https://www.sncf.com/en/booking-itinerary/itinerary). It’s a 25 minute walk from the Foix train station to the Centre Universitaire, but we will also have 2 minivans to pick up folks at the station. 

## Accomodation

Most of us will be staying in individual rooms at the Centre Universitaire. The registration fee will cover lodging at the Centre from the afternoon of August 22nd through the morning of August 28th. Those who do not wish to stay at the Centre can book their own hotel room, there are some good options within walking distance, between the Centre and the train station.
