## Travel

Participants should aim to arrive on Sunday, August 20th. The workshop will officially end on the evening of the 25th, but participants can stay through August 26th if they wish to participate in field trips.

One easy way to get to Foix is by train through Toulouse (~70 minutes by regional train “TER” from Toulouse’s Matabiau station: https://www.sncf.com/en/booking-itinerary/itinerary). It’s a 25 minute walk from the Foix train station to the Centre Universitaire, but we will also have 2 minivans to pick up folks at the station. 

## Accomodation

Most of us will be staying in the Foix camp site. Those who do not wish to stay at the camp site can book their own hotel room, there are some good options within walking distance, between the Centre and the train station.
