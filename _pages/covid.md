Due to COVID crisis, we cannot accept more than 40 participants in total. We will postpone the workshop in case of national/regional lockdown (no video-conference option).

## PCR test

It is strongly recommended to take PCR test just before your departure, or that you be vaccinated.

## On Site management

In the university center, each participant will be given her/his own room (otherwise hotel room outside). The amphitheater and atelier rooms are large but we prepare masks and alcohol gel to control the sanitary situation.
