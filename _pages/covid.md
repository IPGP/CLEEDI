Due to COVID crisis, we cannot accept more than 40 participants in total. We will postpone the workshop in case of national/regional lockdown (no video-conference option).

We are well aware that, while under control in France right now, the COVID situation could quickly deteriorate. However, because of the relatively small number of attendees (~35), and the fact that our accommodations will allow social distancing (large amphitheater, individual roomsâ€¦) we are hopeful that we can organize a safe and enjoyable workshop. 

## PCR test

It is strongly recommended to take PCR test just before your arrival at the workshop, or that you are vaccinated (two shots).

## On Site management

In the university center, each participant will be given her/his own room (otherwise hotel room outside). The amphitheater and atelier rooms are large but we prepare masks and alcohol gel to control the sanitary situation.
